    <p>Hello fellow pupil of TOP or Mr. Recruiter, I don't know which of the two it is but either way you are very welcome.
        Here, I have made a small attempt at making a bare bones website using only HTML (it's my first one) where I present the recipes for a few dishes of 
        the Bengali cuisine, hope you like to go through it. </p>
