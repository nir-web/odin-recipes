    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Sheddho Bhaat is a traditional Bengali dish consisting of simple,
        plain boiled rice served with a variety of side dishes, typically
        including lentils (dal), vegetables, and fish. It's a staple comfort
        food in Bengali households, often eaten during days of fasting, illness,
        or when a light, easy meal is needed. The rice is usually accompanied by
        a modest, flavorful dal, vegetables like aloo (potatoes) or begun (eggplant),
        and sometimes a fish like hilsa or mackerel. Sheddho Bhaat reflects
        the minimalist, soothing aspect of Bengali cuisine, highlighting the
        natural flavors of the ingredients without overpowering them with heavy spices.</p>

                <li>Rinse the rice thoroughly in water to remove excess starch</li>
                <li>Boil water in a pot (about 2 cups of water for 1 cup of rice)</li>

                <li>Cook the rice on medium heat until it becomes soft and the water is absorbed</li>
                <li>Once cooked, fluff the rice gently with a fork and set it aside. You can drizzle a

            <ul>
                <li>For Potatoes (Aloo): Heat mustard oil in a frying pan. Add chopped potatoes and fry
                     until golden and soft. Sprinkle a little turmeric powder and salt to taste.
                     Optionally, add green chilies for extra flavor.</li>
                <li>For Eggplant (Begun): Heat mustard oil in a pan and fry the chopped eggplant pieces until
                     they soften and turn golden. Add a pinch of turmeric powder and salt for seasoning.</li>
                <li>Cook the vegetables until they are tender and well-coated with spices. Set aside.</li>
            </ul>
